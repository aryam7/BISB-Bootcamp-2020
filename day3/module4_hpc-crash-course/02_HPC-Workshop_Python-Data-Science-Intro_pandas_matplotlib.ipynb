    "\n",
    "For the three packages we'll be going through for this series of notebooks, they have different conventions for how they're called in people's code. The shorthand for `numpy` is `np`, `pandas` is `pd`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` is `plt`. If you find any code online (e.g., through StackOverflow) and you see these terms, these are the packages they're usually referring to! "
