If you find any code online (e.g., through StackOverflow) and you see these terms, these are the packages they're usually referring to! "

    "Pandas is an open-source data analysis package in Python that aids in data analysis and manipulation using `DataFrame` and `Series` objects. These `DataFrame` objects can be thought of as multidimensional arrays with attached row and column tables, similar to the tables found in Excel Spreadsheets or `data.frame` objects in the R Programming Language. The `Series` objects can be thought of as a single column with connected row and column labels. Pandas also has tools for reading and writing data between in-memory structures and different commonly-used formats, such as CSV, text files, Microsoft Excel sheets, SQL databases, and the HDF5 format. \n",

This is an important skill to learn as it helps you test new methods and functions you might find in the Pandas documentation.
