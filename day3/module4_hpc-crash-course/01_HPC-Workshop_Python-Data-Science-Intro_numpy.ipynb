    "NumPy, which stands for \"**Num**erical **Py**thon\", is an open-source project that aims to enable numerical computing with Python. In Python, we have a data structure called `lists` that serve the purpose of arrays; however, they are slow to process. NumPy introduces a new type of array object within Python called the `ndarray` that is more efficient than the `list` structure. Additionally, NumPy also provides functions for working in the domain of linear algebra, matrices, and fourier transformations. \n",
