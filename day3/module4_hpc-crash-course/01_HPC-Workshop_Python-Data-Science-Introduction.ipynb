    "Before we start coding, we want to import the `modules` that we'll be using in our notebook. This is the same as importing the modules at the beginning of a Python script. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the three packages we'll be going through, they have different conventions for how they're called in people's code. The shorthand for `pandas` is `pd`, `numpy` is `np`, and `matplotlib.pyplot` is `plt`. If you find any code online (e.g., through StackOverflow) and you see these terms, these are the packages they're usually referring to! "
