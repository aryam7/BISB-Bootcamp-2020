# Module 2: Genomic Technologies

**Module Instructor**: Cameron Martino (cmartino at eng dot ucsd dot edu)

This module will cover the basics of genomic technologies, from the definition of "-omics" to the various techniques, technologies, analyses, and validations that are undertaken by molecular biologists and bioinformaticians to understand the world around us. We will start with a brief primer on the history of DNA-sequencing, from the start of Sanger sequence, through Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), and continuing into current technologies, such as single molecule sequencing and long-read sequencing. In addition to the technologies, we will also cover the different types of sequencing and why people use them in a specific study.
