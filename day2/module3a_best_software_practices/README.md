This module will cover the basics of software for those that don't have much formal experience in programming! We will cover the essential programming languages to know as a Bioinformatician, as well as what resources to look into for learning those languages. Next, we'll cover the anatomy of software programs with code snippets in *Python 3*: this will include variables and values, value types, and various data structures that are found in Python. Next, we'll cover some basic algorithms that can be performed on data structures before going into testing and debugging code.
