This interactive module is meant to help students get their personal computers configured for programming locally or for accessing a remote compute cluster. After installing commonly-used applications and software packages that are used for data analysis in bioinformatics, we will get our feet wet with using them! If there is time during this module, we will also go over basic programming concepts that are typically covered in the beginning of introductory computer science classes. 

### Goals of the Module

1. Help students set-up a Terminal application on their local computer 
2. Install the `conda` package manager (via `miniconda`)
3. Configure the `bioconda` channel for downloading bioinformatics software
4. Install several commonly-used Python packages for data analysis, including: `jupyterlab`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `matplotlib` 
5. Create and configure a `conda` environment for using the R Programming Language in a Jupyter Notebook 
6. Configure `ssh` keys for accessing the `Triton Shared Compute Cluster (TSCC)` on a student's local computer 

## Module 1a Disclaimer

*This module assumes that you have a personal computer running either the macOS, Ubuntu, or Windows 10 operating systems.*
