Other terminal-based text editors include `emacs` and `nano` (you can see `nano` in action in this other [UNIX tutorial](http://korflab.ucdavis.edu/bootcamp.html) offered by UC Davis). Each of these applications has their own unique feel to them, but for this module, we'll be sticking with `vim`. \n",
