    "# Pair Programming\n",
    "BISB Bootcamp 2020\n",
    "\n",

    "24 September 2020\n",

    "## Workshop Goals\n",
    "- What is pair programming and why is it useful?\n",
    "- Programming and algorithms practice!\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is pair programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pair programming is more or less what it says on the tin - two people, working on the same programming problem with on a shared workstation (one keyboard, one mouse).**  The intuition behind this practice is that the two programmers collaborate closely on the same programming problem, producing higher-quality code while simultaneously learning from each other. Pair programming is used most often in the software industry by so-called \"agile\" development teams, as one of a number of development practices designed to produce high-quality, user-friendly software.\n",
    "\n",
    "When pair programming, the two developers adopt two slightly different roles: **driver** and **navigator**. **The driver uses the keyboard and mouse, while the navigator does not.** This distinction allows them to practice different modes of thinking - the driver constructs the lines of code, leaving the navigator more free to focus on direction and architecture. Generally, developers switch roles every few minutes or so. Fluid communication is important! The driver is still interested in code architecture, and the navigator should be reading the code as it is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use this notebook\n",
    "This module presents a number of bioinformatics algorithms problems of varying difficulty. They are intended to be solved as a pair, but of course you can solve them on your own as well!\n",
    "You can find these problems, and a solution checker, at [rosalind.info](rosalind.info).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notebook cells will contain markdown text, describing the problem and linking to the corresponding rosalind page. **The rosalind page contains detailed problem descriptions, biological motivation, and test cases!** This notebook is just to help you organize your code solutions. Following the description, a code cell is provided as a sandbox for code development. Sometimes the code cell will have starter code or comments to get you started.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feel free to skip around to find problems of your skill level. Solutions can be found in the pair-programming-solutions notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "(NB: Rosalind.info was developed in the Python 2 language. This notebook is written in Python 3. You may see some minor syntax differences between this notebook and snippets from the rosalind site. "
