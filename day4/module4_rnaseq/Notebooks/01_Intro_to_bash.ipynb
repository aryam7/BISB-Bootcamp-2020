    "Unix is a widely used multi-user operating system. It was invented in the late 1960s, and preceded the “graphical user interface” that we use regularly on our modern computers. We know this typing and command-issuing environment as a “command-line interface,” which allows for the easy point-and-click, icon-based interactions with our computers. We will use a interpreter/command language called Bash to operate Unix.\n",
